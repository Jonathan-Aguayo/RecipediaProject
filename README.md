# Recipedia 
This is a project made by me and 3 other classmates for a class project. This is a website that allows you to search for recipes based on the ingredients you have at home. It differentiates itself from other similar websites by adding a social media aspect. Users are allowed to follow each other and like each others recipe posts.
